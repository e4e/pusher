# Understanding Pusher

Pusher is a simple hosted API for quickly, easily and securely integrating realtime bi-directional functionality via WebSockets to web and mobile apps, or any other Internet connected device.

We offer a rich suite of [libraries](https://pusher.com/docs/libraries) that you can use within your applications, including a [JavaScript client library](https://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/#lang=js) for web and HTML5 apps.

Our **event based abstraction** makes it simple to bind UI interactions to events that are triggered from any client or server.

We use WebSockets (with [fallbacks to Flash and HTTP](https://pusher.com/docs/fallbacks) in the JavaScript client library) to future proof your applications and make it easy for you to add **bi-directional communication** to your apps whilst keeping data usage to a minimum.

As well as a WebSockets API, we have a [REST API](https://pusher.com/docs/rest_api) for publishing your messages. This is ideally suited to web server technologies and we have a set of [REST API libraries in many common languages](https://pusher.com/docs/libraries#rest_libraries) to help you to do this.

We have a simple **Publish/Subscribe** model based on channels that allows you to filter and control how people receive your messages.

We supply functionality such as authentication mechanisms for [private channels](https://pusher.com/docs/private_channels), and [presence](https://pusher.com/docs/presence) functionality for keeping track of who’s online.

We give you tools for [debugging your applications](https://pusher.com/docs/debugging), and if you get stuck, you can always [get in touch](https://pusher.com/about/contact) with us for a chat.
